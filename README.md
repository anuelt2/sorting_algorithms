# Sorting Algorithms & Big O

Welcome to my project on sorting algorithms and Big ). This project focuses on learning and implementation of sorting algoritms and Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.

## Features
- Implementation of different sorting algorithms
- At least four different sorting algorithms covering:
    - Bubble sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Selection sort
    - Quick sort

## Getting Started

### Compilation
Compilation with gcc with the following options:
```bash
-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
```
### Project Details
- Language: C
- Standard: Gnu89

### Mandatory Tasks
- 0. Bubble sort
- 1. Insertion sort
- 2. Selection sort
- 3. Quick sort
